This one is complete game implemetation, If you haven't understand problem statement yet , then start as per following steps.

Step 1: First implement User Input Circuit using pushbuttons and resistors, calibrate it.[See calibration code-Calb.ino]
Step 2: Use random functions to generate random parameters stated in problem statement, so later you can use it. Ex: generaates 
        row and col, score , timeout values.Make functions of individual that can be used on later stage.
Step 3: Implement LCD interfacing code with Uno , but as per specified in document, devide display into frame area, game score 
        area and game timeout area, Display some random values generataes using above functions and make it working as stated 
        in problem.
Step 4: Understand use of delay() and millis() function.Justify one for your solution.
Step 5: Now, just integrate all codes as per problem statement.

NOTE: Implement and understand step1-4 as individual  and in step 5 try to make full code w.r.t problem statement.
       Try to implment functions , so you can use it on later stage.
